# Computer Technology
#### Over the past decade, computers have developed more than I would have ever thought when I was a child. In this class, I have learned many useful sofware techniques that I wasn't very familiar with. Besides Excel and Word, Databases were a huge one for me to learn. I am a Mac user and always have been except for when I went to school, but other than that, I was never introduced to it. 
+ MICROSOFT EXCEL
+ MICROSOFT WORD
+ MICROSOFT ACCESS
#### With microsoft excel, I was able to create a budget that my family and I can use in a different manner. It was almost like what I knew but much faster and advanced. 
#### With microsoft word, I was able to create a table that allowed me to see that I can use certain headings to automatically create a font, and size on its own. 
#### With microsoft access, I was able to create databases and link them togwther in a way that they can work together, almost like an information tree.
