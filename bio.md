# BIOGRAPHY
## How it all began
I remember living in Peru but to be honest, those memories have become blurry. My mother had migrated to America after giving birth to her second child, my baby brother. For as long as I can remember, my brother and I have been inseparable. I like to think our real lives began when we came to America to finally live with my mother. 
## America at last
When my 7 year old brother and I landed in New York, we didn't know what to think. It was pretty much gonna be like meeting our mother since we hadn't seen her since we were toddlers. There were a few things I remember that stood out that we weren't used to:
#### 1. Three small children
#### 2. Super cold weather we weren't used to
#### 3. Lots of trees 
#### As silly as it sounds, we were introduced to our 3 little brothers and I knew it was in for a rude awakening. My brother and I had never really experienced cold weather in Peru, at least not in the region we lived in. In addition, as many trees as we had seen that day didn't exist either.  
## Growing up 
My childhood was great for the first few years, or at least until I became a teenager.I began to be wiser and aware of all my surroundings. I don't have the best of memories my teenager years so I'm not even gonna talk about those times. But one thing I learned from those years was to be the parent you would have loved having or for others, the parent you had. I forgot to mention, I learned to not have 5 children as my mother did. Being the oldest and the only female was hard so I had a lot of pressure put on me.  
## Time to go
When I was a senior in high school, I had made up my mind that I was going to join the Marine Corps. No other branch had ever crossed my mind so I never doubted it. I had joined for several reasons but I knew that it was to finally be independent and to be able to have school security. Long story short, joining the marine corps was 100% life changing and I wouldn't chnage it for the world. I am going to school debt free, I have learned so much in the time spent serving, and best of all, I got to meet the greatest man whom I now call my husband. We now have a 2 year-old-dauther that we love so much.
